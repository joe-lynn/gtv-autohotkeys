#NoEnv  ; Recommended for performance and compatibility with future AutoHotkey releases.
#Warn ; common errors
#SingleInstance force
SendMode Input  ; Recommended for new scripts due to its superior speed and reliability.
SetWorkingDir %A_ScriptDir%  ; Ensures a consistent starting directory.
SetTitleMatchMode, 2 ; Necessary to match on the name of the window instead of window class in IfWinActive.

; shift+control+alt+r becomes a hotkey to reload this script. For me it is necessary to
; reload it after starting the game - with the hotkey I can do it without ever going to 
; the desktop. Please note if you have any other program that uses this particular long
; key combo this will replace it througout your Windows.

+^!r::Reload ; Assign Shift-Ctrl-Alt-R as a hotkey to restart the script.
	Sleep 1000 ; If successful, the reload will close this instance during the Sleep, so the line below will never be reached. 
	MsgBox, 4,, The script could not be reloaded. Would you like to open it for editing? 
	IfMsgBox, Yes, Edit

; Grand Theft Auto V / Online specific macros begin here. Everything below the IfWinActive statement

; Why all these manual pauses and explicitly specifying both button press and button release,
; when I could be using SetKeyDelay? Because I couldn't get SetKeyDelay to work reliably in
; GTAO. This may be ugly, but if it's ugly and works perfectly its good enough for me. 

; I made the steps into gosubs, just to make the actual macros below more readable and easy
; to edit. If your computer can handle even faster menu interaction, change the 60 in the 
; Sleep statements to 50 or less. You'll probably start seeing lower reliability.
